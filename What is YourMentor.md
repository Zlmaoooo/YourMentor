# About YourMentor(BootCamp) ðŸ‘‡


YourMentor, the bootcamp that originated during my first year at Btesh CSE at ADTU in 2028, has left a lasting impact on my academic journey. It was a dynamic initiative created by my seniors, designed to introduce newcomers to the world of programming. The inaugural year focused specifically on C programming, providing a solid foundation in coding and problem-solving.

The sessions, led by the engaging Lungsom Lamnio (often referred to as "Senior" or "Lungsom bhaiya"), were held live on Google Meet, creating an interactive learning environment that fostered collaboration and camaraderie among participants. These sessions were not just educational; they were also enjoyable and infused with a sense of community, making complex concepts more accessible and less intimidating.

Throughout the Bootcamp, you delved into various essential topics, such as:

# Fundamentals of C Programming: 
I learned about data types, variables, operators, control structures (if statements, loops), and functions. These core principles formed the backbone of my programming knowledge.

# Problem Solving: 
The bootcamp emphasized practical problem-solving techniques. Through coding challenges and exercises, I developed critical thinking skills and learned how to approach problems methodically.

# Debugging Techniques: 
I gained insights into debugging, understanding common errors, and troubleshooting code. This skill is invaluable, as it fosters resilience and patience in the face of challenges.

# Collaborative Projects: 
The bootcamp encouraged teamwork through collaborative coding projects. Working with peers allowed you to experience real-world software development practices, such as version control and code reviews.

# Live Demonstrations: 
Lungsom's engaging demonstrations helped visualize complex concepts. These live examples made it easier to grasp abstract ideas and apply them to my coding projects.

# Community Engagement: 
The bootcamp created a supportive network of peers and seniors. Sharing experiences, asking questions, and receiving feedback enhanced my learning experience.

The notes I compiled during the sessions became a valuable resource, capturing not just the technical aspects but also the enthusiasm and spirit of learning that characterized YourMentor. Reflecting on this experience, it's clear that it played a crucial role in shaping my programming skills and igniting my passion for computer science.

Overall, YourMentor was more than just a bootcamp; it was a transformative experience that laid the groundwork for my future endeavors in the field of technology.
